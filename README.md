# Security Compliance Update 2024

## Dear Convatec GitHub Users,

We hope this message finds you well. We are implementing critical security measures to enhance the protection of our GitHub environment and ensure the safety of sensitive company data.

### Activation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

*Effective Date:* May 14th

As part of our commitment to security, we will be enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) across all accounts within our GitHub organizations. This measure is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard your accounts.

*Action Required:*
- Ensure you have a reliable method to receive 2FA codes, such as a mobile authenticator app or a security key.
- Set up 2FA by the specified date to maintain access to your account.

For detailed instructions on setting up 2FA, please visit [GitHub's 2FA setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

### Update of User Details to Follow Internal Username Convention

*Compliance Deadline:* May 14th

We are standardizing usernames across our GitHub instance to streamline user management and enhance security protocols.

*Username Format Requirements:*
- For Convatec employees: FirstnameLastnameCvT
- For vendors/contractors: FirstnameLastnameVendorName

*Examples:*
- Vendor/Contractor: JohnPhilipsNexer
- Internal Company Employee: JaneAustenCvT

*Action Steps:*
- Log into your GitHub account.
- Navigate to your account settings.
- Update your username to comply with the above format.
- Confirm all profile details are correct, including Name and Email.

### *URGENT NOTICE:*

*FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS BY MAY 14TH WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT OF 2FA AND POTENTIAL AUTOMATIC REMOVAL FROM OUR GITHUB CLOUD INSTANCE BY GITHUB ITSELF.*
